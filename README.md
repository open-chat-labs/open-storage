## Open-Storage

A scalable storage solution built on the Internet Computer.

Please note, OpenStorage is currently being built with the primary goal of hosting files on behalf of OpenChat. In the future we plan on turning OpenStorage into an easy to use standalone service which anyone can make use of for storing files on the Internet Computer.
